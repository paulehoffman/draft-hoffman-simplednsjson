                     draft-hoffman-simplednsjson-01

Abstract

   This draft is now a tombstone.  The -00 version of this document has
   a likely-bad suggestion of how encode DNS queries for A and AAAA
   RRtypes, and only for those RRtypes, in JSON.  The author no longer
   recommends to do this.
